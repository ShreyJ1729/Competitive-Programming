The annual migration of Snow Geese is one of the greatest wildlife spectacles in North America.  
Snow geese spend winters in the coastal marshes and interior wetlands of the United States and 
find summer breeding grounds in the tundra of the Alaskan and Canadian Arctic, stopping daily 
to feed on roots and unharvested grain. Snow Geese travel and forage in noisy flocks often 
numbering in the tens of thousands and follow a cycle that requires them to fly thousands of 
miles each year. The flock is able to change direction rapidly because birds can mimic the 
maneuvers of distant flock members and do not wait for cues from adjacent birds.
